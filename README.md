# numeric_decode
This Python code is designed to perform numeric conversions between different bases: hexadecimal, binary, and decimal. It provides a menu-driven interface for users to:

-Convert a hexadecimal string to a decimal number.
-Convert a binary string to a decimal number.
-Convert a binary string to its hexadecimal representation.

The program handles user input, removes common prefixes (like 0x for hex and 0b for binary), and then manually calculates the decimal or hexadecimal equivalents through custom functions without relying on Python's built-in conversion functions, except the hex() subfunction in binary_to_hex() main function as othwerwise it would get too complicated.
